Wi-Fi Direct Inter-Group and Multi-Group Communication on Android Platform(Java)

(1) Background: Android (API Level 14) capable of Wi-Fi Direct communication. However, the API only provides part of support for inter-group communication (lack of routing mechanism), and not support multi-group communication. 

(2) Inter-group group talk solutions: Use Current Peers List to save devicesâ€™ information and routing information. 

(3) Multi-group group talk solutions: Use Ap to connect different gourp member.
